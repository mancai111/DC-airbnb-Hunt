# DC Airbnb Analysis

This team project's purpose is to investigate the Airbnb listings in Washington D.C. 

For midterm aim, we produced EDA Analysis to provide suggestions for booking Airbnb based on a listing's neighborhood, rating, price, room type, review score, etc. 

For final aim, we designed a few records of properties with corresponding features like original dataset's records. We created several machine learning models (linear regression, regression tree, KNN, random forest) to provide recommendation for prices of designed lisitngs. The predictions are evaluated with techniques of various performance scores.

This data will comes from Inside Airbnb (http://insideairbnb.com/get-the-data.html), an open-source data tool providing web scraped Airbnb listing information by city. The raw Washington, DC data set has approximately 7,800 records of DC Airbnb listings across 39 neighborhoods dating from March 2012 to September 2021. The dataset features host name, neighborhood, latitude, longitude, room type, price and review scores rating columns that the team will be using for this analysis.
